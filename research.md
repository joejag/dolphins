STRUCTURE

* Cobra Story
    * British Raj - Cobra's killing, put a bounty
    * Worked for a while, until snake catchers realised it's easier to breed cobras than catch wild ones
    * Raj found out and cancelled the sceme. The snake catchers let the Cobra's go lose, making the siutation worse
* 'Perverse Incentive'
    * We want this, we try to get it, we end up with something else
    * These unintended consequences are what we get due to the actions people take to make recieve the incentive
* Why:
 * Purpose -> Measure -> Method
 * Add a perverse incentive and it becomes the 'de-facto purpose', removing the real one.
 * Cultural relationship. Where do you want your peoples ingenuity to be used?
* Activity stories
  * The key is to think whether the measure if about outcome or activity and how it is measured.
  * 100% test coverage. Heard that's great, but decided to mandate 100%, but also outsourced the writing on unit tests to a another country. Two teams of folk on it for three months. All deleted by the teams who inherited them.
  * STORY: The first example in software I could find was... IBM in the 80s created a pay structure that paid folk by line of code written. The original code style wars was between developers rewarded by LoC and book publishers who wanted to make their point on a single page.
  * Think evil.
  * Another company wanted a way to tell if their ScrumMasters were being productive. They decided to measure them by 'blockers removed'. What's worse is the metric they used to measure the PMs was 'projects saved'
* Helpful bit:
  * I've been harsh on activity targets, but that's for each time that a useful measure. Velocity is another good one. Who has worked on a team that was shouted at by a manager for failing to meet their targets? What did you do at the next estimation meeting? 
  * My preference is for measuring CycleTime (how long something stayed went from in progress to done) and Story Count (how many cards did you complete in a two week period). You can do forecasting from here, but it only works if the team is asked to calculate the forecast date, rather than having those numbers used externally. These measures are team level rather than individual.
  * A useful measure is one based to outcome instead of productivity. Such as acquisition, rentention and revenue.
    * For the snakes you could measure snake bites, and task an internal team to keep that number low, rather than using their ingeuity to providing corpses
* Dolphins
  * In case you thought it was just humans that fall into this trap

* Systemic relationship between 
    * purpose (what we are here to do)
    * measures (how we know we are doing)
    * method (how we do it)   
- Adding a productivity measure becomes the 'defacto purpose' removing the real one
    - Call centre: 'calls answered in so many seconds', 'how busy agents are'

* Snakes in India
 - The problem
    - Theory X vs Theory Y
* 100% unit test coverage (story: deleted a third of the codebase) / Scrum Masters blockers
 - The solution
    - The systemic relationship - ingenuity - management working on the works - to both working on the work using a measure from a customers perspective (both parties get a greater control over the work by measures that relate to purpose)
        - culturual relationship - where do you want your peoples ingenuity to be used?
        - "does it help in understanding and improving performance?"
        - Purpose -> Measure -> Method. Gets replaced with Target -> Method
        - capability measures (NOT FOR THIS ONE) - study flow of work - get folk to use the ingenuity here rather than meetings targets
    - cycle time + story count to help the team forecast and improve

Motivation
 - managers can provide conditions that are likel`y to motivate or demotivate.

activity vs purpose measures


Liz Keogh -

Perverse incentitive - we want to get an affect - we put in place a process that is causing another effect that is hindering the ability to get the improvement we want.
NHS 4 hour - As soon as the hit the limit the A&E stopped letting folks in. It made it worse
Agile - rife with perverse incentives - we do this as we like to make things better - but we don't realise the systemic affect
"see the system outside the system" 
The Fifth Discipline - Senge 
    - two types of feedback (reinforcing - create an affect that reinforces it - e.g. motivation)
    - Cakes -> Smile -> Happy (buy more cakes until we hit the limit)
    - balancing feedback (stops reinforcing going to infinity)
    - e.g. hungry -> full -> stop eating (this has a limiting affect)

"fear of things going wrong - cause perverse incentives"

Petrol shortage - wasn't real -> we made it real
Waterfall -> Cost of change is high -> delay it, make it worse

We learn more from failure because we don't notice the successes

Risk is part of doing things worth doing - risk is required when doing something new

We want things to be predictable - we crave it - our literate 
Software is about learning

J Curve - we have to learn the new thing - so to start we get less good

STORY - estimate, "why didn't you make it?" -> "Pad the estimates". Velocity is now going up! It's what you asked them to do. All projects suffer from this.
Liz has 14 more estimate anti-patterns on her blog

STORY 2 - good culture, two devs went to play with a tool for 2 days. It didn't work. "We need to stop this happenings". No one is allowed to do any work without an architect or BA to first approve. Innovation on this project was killed. It was great, created open source, after that dead.

Six thinking hats - black hat. I'm goig to game your process because I'm evil.

Coverage - don't care if the method needs to exist - "how do I test this dead code? Use the caller???"

SM - PM not on the team is holding an emergency meeting for our project. He says we won't make it. Bonus for "resucing projects", stting around, waiting for projects to fail.

Targets: How can I easily get that bonus or reward.

KPI: Evil hat. Here is how I will game these. PM rewarded for removing blockages. If I do see obstacles then I won't do anything about them.
You get what your measure.
Developers rewarded for lines of code they change. Easy job!

Dolphin: Rock, puts paper in the pool. Seagul lands - "We don't want birds in the pool". Takes the fish, puts it under the rock, leaves the fish to grab and drown a seagul.

Measures: Your brain does stuff you are unaware of. Animal part of the brain that is used to be chased.
Maslow hiearachy. 

Bugcount story: Fixing the bugs made folk report them.

The Goal Book: Keep your metrics close to what you want, not sub-parts.

Learning Standup
* This is what I learnt today.
* This is what I hope to learn tomorrow.
* Can anyone help me find outâ€¦ ?

Tune the sysystem, rather than shouting at it. Get the testers to nudge the devs on the way to the standup.

Balacned thinking: Rather than looking at slow stories and shouting, look at fast ones and ask why
Got an expert: Go say thankyou to the Head of IT.
