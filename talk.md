* Intro slide
    * Joe Wright, occasional software coach and the person speaking just now
    * Talk about Animals, systems and perverse incentives
    * Previous talks of mine w/o animals. Help empathy, so I've added cuddly animals to my talks.
* Cobra slide
    * This is a Cobra. Grows to 4 meters long and it's venom can kill you in hours.
    * British Colonial Govt in Delhi. Plaguing people. Policy that offered a bounty for each dead cobra
    * Worked at first. But rather than getting a smaller amount, they got more cobras handed in - they didn't know why
    * What happened was they had created a stable and profitable income stream - but hunting cobras was hard - so they started breeding them instead which were easier to kill
    * The gov discovered these clandestine breeding grounds and cancelled the program. The breeders, stuck with worthless cobras then released them into the city - making the problem worse than it was before
* Perverse Incentive
    * We want something, we try to get it, we end up with something else
    * This is what happens when we make the reward more appealing than fixing the real thing, people change their actions to get the reward
* Purpose -> Measure -> Method
    * There's a systematic relationship in organisation between three things
    * Purpose (what we are here to do), Measure (How we know how we are doing) and Method (How we do it)
    * It's a cultural relationship too. Purpose indicates method, how we measure changes the method.
* Target -> Method
    * The problem is when we add a target or incentive then the purpose gets replaced. The target becomes the 'de-facto' purpose of the system.
    * Targets are always perverse incentives that create complex secondary effects in your org
* Deming
    * Deming summed this up this phenominum by saying folk will always make their targets - even if they have to kill the company
* Fun targets from the real world
    * I've found software to be full of fun perverse incentives. Here's some of my favourites then a question for you
    * All first hand or from someone I know
* 100% test coverage
    * Worked somewhere where the teams with less bugs and more predicatable delivery had higher code coverage. So they measured everyone
    * Then one day an email came out mandating 100% code coverage for all code bases
    * Since some folk said they need training they decided to outsource unit tests to another country
    * Ideally unit tests are examples of the ways your code is used, so you can check it works in isolation.
    * The tests that came back from the poor developers disregarded this entirely and just through random data in, each time pushing the metric up. The developers who inherited these lovely tests in the end had to delete them, as they prevented adding  any new code.
* Lines of Code
    * I thought this was a myth. But it's not. IBM for over two decades measured departments by the kLoC.
    * They also wrote up the contracts with external supplies for them to be paid based on how much code they created
    * While the biggest name in the biz they outsourced developing as operating system to a small startup called Microsoft
    * Now, the IBM staff on the project had developed a code style that is extermelly verbose to try to make themselves look good. Those same IBM staff complained bitterly about the MS code. This eventually led to the collapse of the contract and MS went off to develop an OS for desktops without IBM - which I think worked out for them.
* How do you measure SM and PM?
    * Open question: How do you measure SM and PM?
    * Each time you hear a target I want you to think like those snake catchers. What's the easiest way to reach that goal.
    * Liz Keogh: Evil hat. Goldratt: 'tell me how you'll measure me'
    * One org measured their SM by 'number of blockers removed'
    * The same org measured their PM by 'number of projects saved'
    * How would you behave in those orgs?
* Activity Targets
    * All of the examples I gave are about activity rather than outcome.
    * It's still ok to have measures on activity if they are used as a way to help improve and allow themselves to predict how long a piece of work will take
    * So in the spirit of saying something positive, here's two measurements I find useful in teams
* Cycle Time and Story Count
    * Cycle Time is the measure of how long a work item takes to go from "in progress" to "delivered". It lets you know how long a single piece of work will usually take.
    * Add that with 'story count'. Which is just a measure of how many stories you completed in a given time period like two weeks.
    * Using these you can see if changing your method is improving things. Also it allows the business to ask you how long it'll take to complete a new bit of work or existing work.
    * This is similar to 'velocity', but drops the estimation bit. ?Has anyone ever been asked why a bit of work took longer than the estimate? What did you do at the next estimation meeting? And what did that do to the velocity number? Shout at people -> work harder.
    * TRANS-> So what should we measure, or target if anything?
* Outcome over Output
    * We should target outcomes associated with the purpose of our organisation, and forget about targetting activity measures.
    * The reason most orgs don't do this is that it can be complex to figure out, and it's a lot easier to measure activity rather than outcome.
    * If you sell cars measure how many cars you sell and customers come back to buy from you. If you are a service centre measure how much failure demand you have and try to efficiently delight your customers from their perspective.
    * If you want to reduce snake bites in Delhi then measure that. Rather than how many dead snakes you have.
    * I've been using this same slide now for over 5 years. Both sides of this coin are important, Hands please!
    * Beware of any target you incentivise people to meet. Put your evil hat on and consider how it could be gamed.
    * TRANS-> I've one last story for you. One that shows that perverse incentives aren't just a human trait
* Dolphins
    * It's well known that Dolphins are the second most intelligent spieces on earth, after mice.
    * At the Institute for Marine Mammal Studies in Mississippi, a dolphin named Kelly
    * Their trainers trained them to collect litter from their pool and they will recieve fish for each piece of litter they collected.
    * Kelly figured out the size of the litter made no difference to the reward. She had a rock in her pool which she used to rip up the litter and keep a bit for later.
    * One day a bird landed in her pool and she took it to her trainers. They decided this was worth an extra reward. But instead of gobbling the extra reward she hid the fish under her rock. She then used the extra fish to lure birds into her pool as bait.
    * They've kept this going in Missisipi and now Kelly has passed on the traits onto her children who copy the behaviour
    * Beware of snake-catchers, dolphins and activity targets - thank you!
